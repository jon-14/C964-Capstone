# Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression
For my computer science capstone project, I created a machine learning model using logistic regression to categorize transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

The model achieved an overall accuracy rate of 63%. The main challenge of this project was working with an unbalanced dataset, as less than 1% of the transactions were fraudulent.

Please see <em>fraud_detection_notebook.ipynb</em> for an overview of the development and accuracy analysis of the model. I will update this README when I have shared a non-static version of the notebook.

I used the following synthetic dataset for training and testing the model:

Note: This project was developed using a virtual environment. If you happen to try running the notebook on your local machine, I recommend following the instructions in <em>UserGuide.pdf</em>.
